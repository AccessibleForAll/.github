# Welcome to the AccessibleForAll community!

AccessibleForAll is a community dedicated to making the web more accessible for everyone, and that starts by educating designers and developers in accessibility best practices from an early stage. 

The official documentation can be difficult for beginners to use and interpret. Here you will find repositories full of resources about accessibility with a focus on making it easier to understand and get started.

## Want to contribute?

That's great! We welcome all sorts of contributions from raising issues, starting discussions, adding documentation, making pull requests and so much more! Check the contributing guidelines in each repository for guidance on how to get started.
