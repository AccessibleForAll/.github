## What are we doing?

### The problem
- Around 15% of the world population has some sort of impairment or disability. Many modern web apps and sites are not usable because of inaccessible design and code.
- Accessibility education is poor for most available courses, but especially those designed for self directed learning.
- There’s a lack of easy to understand resources on accessibility, most documentation is written for use by legal professionals and not necessarily designers and developers.

### The solution
- Create easy to understand reference materials for designers and developers to use, which reference more technical documentation where needed.
- Create a bank of accessible components for use in web development projects.
- Create tools to make designing and developing accessible websites and apps easier.

## Who are we?

The founder of Accessible For All is [Emma Dawson](https://github.com/EmmaDawsonDev), a software developer from Sweden with a passion for both accessibility and open source. Our current maintainers are [Cristian Toffanin](https://github.com/ctoffanin). 

The projects present in this organisation are all developed and maintained by volunteers.

## What do we need?

**You**! In whatever way you can help.

We need expertise in website and app development, accessibility, design, testing, software sustainability, documentation and technical writing and so much more!

We'd love your feedback along the way, and of course, we'd love you to be a contributor.

## Get involved

Want to get involved? That's great! We welcome all sorts of contributions from raising issues, starting discussions, adding documentation, making pull requests and so much more! 

We currently have several projects on the go. Take a look at the issues and check the contributing guidelines in each repository for guidance on how to get started.
